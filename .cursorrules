# Cursor Rules for Nexo Project

## Build and Deployment Rules

**CRITICAL: DO NOT BUILD OR DEPLOY WITHOUT USER CONFIRMATION**

- NEVER run `npm run build:mobile` or `npm run build` without explicit user confirmation
- NEVER run `firebase deploy` or any deployment commands without explicit user confirmation
- ALWAYS ask the user "Soll ich die Änderungen jetzt bauen?" or "Should I build the changes now?" before building
- ALWAYS ask the user "Soll ich die Änderungen jetzt deployen?" or "Should I deploy the changes now?" before deploying
- Wait for the user's explicit "yes", "ja", "build", "deploy", or similar confirmation before executing any build or deployment
- If the user says "build again", "deploy again" or similar, that counts as confirmation
- After successful deployment, ALWAYS push changes to Git with an appropriate commit message
- Use `git add .`, `git commit -m "message"`, and `git push` after deployment is confirmed successful

## General Development Rules

- Always test changes locally when possible before suggesting deployment
- Provide clear explanations of what will be deployed
- Use German language for user-facing messages when the user communicates in German
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions in the codebase
- Ensure all linter errors are resolved before suggesting deployment
